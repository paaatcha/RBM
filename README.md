# Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)

This repository contains my own implementations of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). I implemented that using NumPy and TensorFlow, you can use whatever you want.

If you find any bug or have any comment, feel free to email me.


## Dependencies
* Python 2.7.x
* NumPy
* Tensorflow <= 1.9 (if you wanna use it)
* Scikit-learn
